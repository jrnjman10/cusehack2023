# cusehack2023

This was our first hackathon project, in which we had 12 hours.

We working on creating player movement, original art, and terrain.

The player movement was done twice as in the first attempt, there ended up being some unwanted features

The art featured a rendition of Syracuse University's Mascot Otto the Orange and the Dome was featured as well

While it did feel like there was a lot to do in a little time, the team kept at it all the way until the end
